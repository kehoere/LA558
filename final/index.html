My final project will focus on what American zoos offer in order to achieve high ratings and be successful in both animal welfare and visitor happiness. 
<br>
<br>
I propose to continue my exploration of the top rated American zoos in retrospect to animal welfare and visitor expectations. I wish to study the location of the top zoos, one from each region in the USA (West, Midwest, Southwest, Southeast, and Northeast). I would like to know what type of animal species are in the top rated zoos, what is the population of the highest viewed animals, and what types of animal habitats are most viewed and successful. This also relates to visitor happiness outcomes. What do visitors want or expect to achieve by experiencing zoos? The goal is to understand what makes these top rated zoos successful.

<br>
Listing of the technology you will use: <br>
        • Leafet and/or GeoJSON
        • HighCharts
<br>
<br>
Data sources: <br>
    • https://www.nationalgeographic.org/maps/united-states-regions/ <br>
    • individual zoo sites including information from the top zoos in the 5 regions of the USA: San Diego Zoo, Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, Houston Zoo, Memphis Zoo, and Bronx Zoo.
<br>
<br>
Format of this data: <br>
    • Map of the 5 zoo locations in the United States of America including an overlay of the regions <br>
    • 3-4 charts showcasing the animal species, visitor expections of the zoo, and types of animal habitat, and population of animal species. 
<br>
<br>    
Challenges: <br>
    • finding data on visitor happiness outcomes and expectations of zoos <br>
    • formating the final website to present the final maps, charts, and information as best as possible
